## Description

Our program will scrape a real estate website ([Immoweb](https://www.immoweb.be/en)) for data about houses and apartments
in Belgium. Once the information is fetched it will be cleaned and stored in a CSV file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the required libraries
3. Install Selenium WebDriver
4. Run main.py

## Starting and running

After starting, our program there is 4 different Python Documents

1- get_links.py : this document using the Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries to scrape a website for links.

The driver_gen() function initializes a webdriver object using the Chrome browser and returns it.

The get_links() function takes two arguments: iterations and driver. It then creates an empty list called list_of_link. The function then iterates over the values in iterations and for each value, it builds a URL and visits it using the driver. It then creates a Beautiful Soup object from the page source and uses it to find all a tags with a class of card\_\_title-link. It appends the href attribute of each of these tags to list_of_link and then quits the driver. Finally, it returns list_of_link.

The link_file() function takes one argument, datas, and writes it to the file specified in the test variable, with a newline character at the end.

-

2- threads.py : This document using the get_links() function from another module (presumably called get_links) to scrape a website for links and write them to a file.

The pool() function takes two arguments: numbers_drivers and pages. It creates a list of numbers_drivers webdriver objects using the driver_gen() function and stores it in the drivers list. It then divides the range of integers from 1 to pages into numbers_drivers equal parts using numpy.array_split() and stores the resulting list of arrays in division.

Next, it creates a thread pool using ThreadPoolExecutor and a with block. It then uses the map() method of the executor to apply the get_links() function to each element in division with the corresponding element in drivers. Finally, it iterates over the results of this operation, writing each element to the file specified in the test variable using the link_file() function.

-

3- scrapin_data.py :t his document using the BeautifulSoup library to parse an HTML page and extract information from it. It appears to be using the requests library to make HTTP requests to retrieve the HTML pages.

The clean_data() function reads the links from a file and makes an HTTP GET request to each of these links using the requests library. It then creates a Beautiful Soup object from the HTML content of the page and finds all script tags in the page. It passes this list of tags to the organise_data() function and returns the result of this function.

The organise_data() function takes a list of script tags as its argument. It then iterates over the list and checks if either "window.dataLayer" or "window.classified" is present in the script tag. If either of these is present, it extracts certain information from the tag and stores it in variables. It then creates an empty dictionary called property_details and adds key-value pairs to it using the extracted information. Finally, it appends property_details to a list called list_of_properties and returns this list.

The save_to_csv() function takes a list of dictionaries as its argument and creates a Pandas DataFrame from it. It then writes this DataFrame to a CSV file and returns the file's name.

4- main.py: Main code for running the program and pool function.
